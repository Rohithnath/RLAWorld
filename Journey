            <p style="text-align: left; width: 85%;"><b>The</b> first thing that pops in our head when talking about Paris, is the Eiffel Tower, one of the most popular places to go in
                Paris. Named after engineer Gustave Eiffel, Eiffel Tower is a lattice tower made of wrought iron and is considered to be the
                 most important places to see in Paris. Built in 1889 as the main doorway to World Fair, it is now a cultural icon of not only
                  Paris but entire France. The tallest structure in Paris – 1063 feet tall with 3 levels open for visitors – tops the list 
                  of must see tourist attractions in Paris. The first two floors have restaurants and shops while the top level boasts of 
                  the most magnificent and best bird’s eye view of Paris.<br/>

This is a place that is worth visiting. This is a place where you can have a completely different experience. It is not only one of the topmost 
urist attractions in the city but it also one of the most beautiful places in the whole world. Without visiting this place your Paris trip 
remains incomplete. Make sure that you have enough time while visiting this place.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><u>Main Attractions</u></b></p>
<p>The tower has two restaurants: Le 58 Tour Eiffel on the first level, and Le Jules Verne, a gourmet restaurant with its own lift on the second 
level. This restaurant has one star in the Michelin Red Guide. 
The tower has operated at its maximum capacity of about 7 million visitors since 2003. In 2004, the Eiffel Tower began hosting a seasonal ice 
rink on the first level. A glass floor was installed on the first level during the 2014 refurbishment.
Not for the faint of heart, the top level of the Eiffel Tower stands at a dizzying height of 276 meters. The summit of the Eiffel Tower continues
 several meters higher with the radio antenna reaching 320 meters. To arrive at the top level, take the elevator from the second level. There are 
 two viewing platforms, one is inside under a roof and the other is in the open air for a thrilling high-altitude sensation. The platforms are more
  compact than the first and second levels and definitely not suited for those who fear heights. From the viewing platforms, enjoy the stunning 
  panoramic views that extend as far as 70 kilometers on a clear day. Notice how small the other Paris monuments seem from this height. The 70-meter
   tower of Notre-Dame is 200 meters below this viewing platform.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b><u>Main Attractions</u></b></p>
<p>
         Indiana Jones ride is a relatively straight-forward roller coaster with a loop, themed as an out-of-control mine cart barreling through 
         an abandoned temple.The design of the ride itself and the expedition camp that makes up the queue looks impressively ramshackle, but it feels 
         a bit slight and undercooked for what is clearly supposed to be a major Disney attraction.  
         Adventure Isle, an elaborate walk-through exhibit beneath (and around) the park’s version of the Swiss Family Treehouse. You can get lost in the 
         winding network of caves at the tree’s base that includes the family’s cellar, and sproing your way across the Floating Bridge.
         Disneyland Park features the iconic Mad Tea Party spinning tea cup ride. It also has a second attraction themed around Alice in Wonderland. 
         Alice’s Curious Labyrinth is a whimsical hedge maze that can be explored at your pace. You don’t have to worry about getting lost

    <p style="text-align:center;"><b><u>Main Attractions</u></b></p>
    <p>
    The monumental west front of Notre-Dame Cathedral reveals the painstaking work of medieval stone cutters, who crafted finely detailed sculptures in the 
    High Gothic style around 1210 to 1230.The cathedral's twin towers are open to the public for visits. The entrance (with admission fee) to the towers is 
    to the left of the front doorways on the Rue du Cloître Notre-Dame, and then there's a climb of 387 steps. Admission allows visitors to see the two towers 
    and the balcony of gargoyles.The sheer immensity of the sanctuary, with its overwhelming sense of spaciousness, leaves many visitors awestruck. The 
    inspiring high-vaulted nave reaches 35 meters and is 130 meters in length (longer than a football field).

            <p style="text-align: left; width: 85%;  ">Amongst the most beautiful and popular places to visit in Paris, Seine River is also known as the heart of Paris. The river is 777 km 
                long is the major source of water in the city. While there’s not much to do at the river, there’s definitely a lot to see around the 
                banks of the river.The Seine river that passes through Paris is often nicknamed “Paris’ most beautiful avenue“, and not for nothing. Some of Paris’ most iconic landmarks are located
                 near the Seine. I highly recommend taking a boat cruise on the Seine so that you get a glimpse of all these monuments from the outside. But it is also worth going on shore to visit 
                 them. The convenient “Vedettes du Pont-Neuf” or even the “Batobus” company offers a good way of navigating on the Seine from one monument to another.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:center;"><b><u>Main Attractions</u></b></p>
                <p>
            You have over 30 along the Seine in the capital. Some have nothing in particular, but others are worth putting on your list of things to do near the Seine River in Paris. For instance,
                 don’t miss the Pont-Neuf – ‘New-Bridge’, which is actually the oldest bridge in Paris, dating back from the early 17th century.
                 You will find the Notre-Dame Cathedral, a stunning example of gothic architecture. Don’t miss the beautiful stained glass, but also the statues on the façade and the gargoyles on the 
                 sides of the cathedral.
